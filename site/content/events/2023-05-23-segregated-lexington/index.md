Join **Barbara Sutherland** and **Rona Roberts**, the local researchers of
[Segregated Lexington](https://www.segregatedlexington.com), as they offer
their eye-opening presentation *Lexington, Kentucky: Segregated by Design*.

Often we think segregated neighborhoods came about by chance, but Rona and
Barbara's research reveals compelling data and archival images to document
sometimes astonishing policies and decisions to the contrary. Following Richard
Rothstein's thought-provoking book *The Color of Law*, they explore multiple
aspects of our forgotten history and how they played out right here in
Lexington. 

- Racially restrictive deed covenants
- Redlining
- Race-based steering by realtors
- Certain planning and zoning practices
- Urban renewal

Following a brief question & answer period, stay to enjoy light refreshments
and informal conversation around our responses and possible ways forward.
