Why do some people in some neighborhoods not have access to parks and
green space?

Greenspace and public space aren't just nice things to have in a community.
Evidence shows that access to greenspace has significant positive effects on
public health, climate resiliency, and more. 

Join **Megan Gulla** in a [Tree Week](https://ufi.ca.uky.edu/treeweek)
presentation about Lexington's past and current local policies have impacted
park access. And what the [Park Equity
Project](https://www.lexingtonparkequity.org/) has been doing to help everyone
have a voice in park decision-making.

Learn where you can volunteer to help with new mini projects to help bring the
benefits of trees and nature to more people.

**Open to the public**

**No registration required**

**This event is kid-friendly and accessible to people with mobility limitations.**
