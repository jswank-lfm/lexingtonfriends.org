<p>Our meetinghouse is at <strong>649 Price Ave</strong>, which is about a mile
north of downtown Lexington.  Price Avenue is a two-block street that runs
parallel to North Broadway off W. 6th Street.  From downtown, take North
Broadway north. Turn left onto Delcamp Dr. and take your second left onto
Price Avenue.  Our parking lot is on the left and our meetinghouse is next to
it.</p>

<p>From New Circle Road, exit onto North Broadway and head south towards town.
Pass under two railroad overpasses and watch for Delcamp Drive on the right. Turn
right onto Delcamp, then take your second left onto Price Avenue.  The
meetinghouse will be the first building on your right.</p>

<p>From the interstates 64 and 75, take exit 113 and head toward Lexington.
This will become North Broadway.  Follow the above instructions from New Circle
Road.</p>
