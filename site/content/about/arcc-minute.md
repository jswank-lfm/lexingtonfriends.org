Anti-racism Coordinating Committee (ARCC)

At this time of racial reckoning in the United States, Lexington Friends
Meeting commits itself to becoming an anti-racist faith community. We recognize
that there is a profound contradiction between our fundamental belief that
there is that of God in every person and the everyday bias against people of
color that pervades our society, including our Meeting. 

To this end, we educate ourselves about the history and causes of racism and
our white supremacy culture. We educate ourselves to recognize and understand
white privilege and the ways it exhibits itself in our broader community, as
well as in our own everyday attitudes, words, and behaviors. We educate
ourselves about the ways racism and white supremacy hurt us all but especially
people of color. Believing there is that of God in all of us, we commit to
listen openly, with empathy, to people’s stories without interrupting or
interpreting. Friends of color have a story that those of us who are white have
never experienced and will never experience because of our privilege. 

We recognize that working to become an anti-racist Meeting is a continuing
spiritual journey, and it will entail times of discomfort and changes in the
Meeting’s culture. We commit to loving, nurturing, and supporting each other
through the challenges. This journey is also one of growing in right
relationship, expanding our awareness and intentionality to become a community
that is multi-generational, multi-cultural and inclusive of many identities. 

Becoming an anti-racist community involves self-education and awareness, but it
also means action. Specifically, we commit to:
* hold discussions that allow us to better understand ourselves and each other 
* look within to uncover the seeds of our own racism (conscious and unconscious) 
planted and nurtured by the racism in our society 
* discern new leadings to see what love can do beyond our meeting community 
* stand in support of those who have faced racist attacks and abuse both inside and 
outside our Meeting, including disparaging and demeaning remarks and bullying. 
* practice accountability for our work, on a continuing basis, holding annual discussions 
to evaluate our anti-racism work. 

As Quakers we are particularly called to take a stand against racism if we are
to live in accordance with our testimonies of equality, integrity, and
community and with our Covenant of Community*. Our Covenant says in part, we
"strive to build a social order free of violence and oppression in which no
person's development is thwarted by poverty, warfare, or the lack of health
care, education, or freedom".

*(Note: The Covenant of Community was approved in 2012. It will be reviewed and updated in 2023.)*
