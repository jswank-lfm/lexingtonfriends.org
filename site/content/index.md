# Welcome!

<div class="notice">
As of Sunday, June 13 we will be meeting in person for worship.  We will still be
supporting virtual participation: [contact us](/contact) for connection information.
</div>

Lexington Friends Meeting is an [unprogrammed](/worship) Quaker meeting.  Our
worship is similar in form to silent meditation.  But, unlike meditation which
is an individual practice, our worship is a group experience.  Most of us feel
knit together in the silence.

We welcome all visitors.  We believe there is that of God in each one of us,
which leads us to be welcoming of diversity and inclusive of all people
regardless of age, race, differing abilities, gender identity, and sexual
orientation.

Worship begins at 10:30am on Sunday preceded by singing from 10:15 to 10:30.
Child and infant care is available during both worship and the morning topical
discussion (<a href="/announcements/">First Hour</a>).  After about 15 minutes
in worship with the adults, children withdraw to participate in religious
education activities with adult volunteers.
