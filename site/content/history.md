According to records held a Wilmington College, Lexington Preparative Meeting
was established in January 1964 under the care of Louisville (KY) Friends
Meeting.  On October 13, 1974, Lexington Friends Meeting was launched as a
full-fledged, monthly meeting of Miami Quarter of Indiana Yearly Meeting of
Friends General Conference, the predecessor of
[Ohio Valley Yearly Meeting](http://www.quaker.org/ovym/).

Until 1990, Lexington Friends met in various locations.  The size of the
meeting varied from a handful of Friends to perhaps 30 at worship.  In 1990,
Friends bought a small building on Bryan Avenue.  The building was a house that
had been converted into a small church.  This facility provided three spaces
for toddlers and children's activities during adult worship.  Over the next
decade the meeting grew to the point that it outgrew the building.

In 2000, Lexington Friends purchased its current meetinghouse at 649 Price
Avenue.  This building provided Friends with much more space for worship and
children's programs.  Unfortunately, the building had become quite rundown.
Eventually Friends embarked on a full renovation and remodel of the building.
The meetinghouse was redesigned to accommodate Quaker worship and social
activities.  Friends began worship in the remodeled building in August 2014.
The lower level was remodeled to host childcare for young children, and the
[Lexington Friends Preschool](http://www.lexingtonfriendspreschool.com/), an
independent, Montessori based program, was established there in 2015.
