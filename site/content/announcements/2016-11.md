# Save the Date

**December 16** LFM Holiday party

**April 7-9, 2017** is when our annual Pine Mountain Retreat will be happening.

# All-Kentucky Gathering

**Sunday, November 6**, the Lexington Friends will be hosting the All-Kentucky
Gathering.  See the [Registration and Schedule](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8QtC5CDCC_aMHdGSTVUY2JvY2M/view) for more information.

Ohio Valley Yearly Meeting Friend **Lois Diann Herzog** will be presenting a
program on spiritual gifts. Some friends might remember an early version of
this offering from a workshop at OVYM yearly meeting sessions several years
ago. Since that time, Diann has been asked to present her material at a number
of monthly meetings and yearly meetings other than our own; she reports that
she has appreciated the opportunity to develop and deepen her offering.

The teens and children will be having their own program with Diann in the
morning on Sunday, while the adults participate in a Meeting for Worship. They
will then travel to the indoor water park in Georgetown for the afternoon. If a
child is three or younger, their parent or guardian should accompany them to
this water activity.
