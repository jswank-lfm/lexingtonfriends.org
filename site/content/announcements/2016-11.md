**April 7-9, 2017** is when our annual Pine Mountain Retreat will be happening.

# All-Kentucky Gathering

**Sunday, November 6**, the Lexington Friends will be hosting the All-Kentucky
Gathering.  See the [Registration and Schedule](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8QtC5CDCC_aMHdGSTVUY2JvY2M/view) for more information.

Ohio Valley Yearly Meeting Friend **Lois Diann Herzog** will be presenting a
program on spiritual gifts. Some friends might remember an early version of
this offering from a workshop at OVYM yearly meeting sessions several years
ago. Since that time, Diann has been asked to present her material at a number
of monthly meetings and yearly meetings other than our own; she reports that
she has appreciated the opportunity to develop and deepen her offering.

The teens and children will be having their own program with Diann in the
morning on Sunday, while the adults participate in a Meeting for Worship. They
will then travel to the indoor water park in Georgetown for the afternoon. If a
child is three or younger, their parent or guardian should accompany them to
this water activity.

# Thanksgiving Day Potluck at the Meetinghouse

PLEASE RSVP: We will not be coordinating food this year.  We expect that with
many people coming we will have the variety we need.  Nevertheless, we are
interested in estimating how many people are coming so we have enough Turkey
and drinks.  Call **Betsy N.** or email **Richard M**.  Please tell us
how many from your household are coming, and of those, how many would like
turkey.

* 1:00 p.m.     Gather
* 1:15 p.m.     We circle for a silent blessing
* 1:17 p.m.     Food & F/friends

# Adult Religious Education (First Hour)

* **November 13** *On Gratitude* - **Audrey R.**
* **November 20** *On Gratitude #2* - **Patricia G.**
* **November 27** *On Gratitude #3* - **Presenter TBD**

We meet in the Library, and start promptly at **9:15am**- even if some of us have
not yet arrived.  We end at 10:15am to join the hymn singing.

If you have an idea for a topic for First Hour Discussion please send it to
the members of the ARE Committee (**Audrey R**, **Elizabeth L**, **Melva
Sue P**, and **Kitrina K**) at **are@lexingtonfriends.org**.

We usually (but not always) anchor the discussion with a reading.  We encourage
you to lead the discussion of your topic, but we will seek another leader if
you prefer.

## First Hour, November 13

*Morning Thanksgiving* by John Drinkwater.

For show and tell at First Hour on November 13, let's bring simple,
little-noticed, surprising objects of love and thankfulness:  things, deeds,
animals, persons we'd not thought much about before.  These may include items
themselves, or as described in poems, stories, songs, and pictures.

We'll let one thing lead to another and by the time we adjourn we'll have a
cornucopia of modest offerings for our silent worship.

## First Hour, November 20

**Patricia G** will lead us as we consider the query: *What difficulty in your
past turned out to be a gratitude?*

## First Hour, November 27

Concluding the November theme, Friends will gather to consider gratitude.

# Potlucks

Our potlucks topics for the month include:

* **November 18** *Building Usage*

We gather at 6:45, begin supper at **7:00pm**, and the program runs from 7:45
until 9:00.

Bring a dish to serve 6. Don't have time to get a dish ready?  Join us anyway.
There's always enough.  

## 3rd Friday Potluck

Our building is used by many groups much of the time.  We'll be reviewing
current usage.
