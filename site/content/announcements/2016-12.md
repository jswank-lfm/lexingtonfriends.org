# Save the Date

**April 7-9, 2017** is when our annual Pine Mountain Retreat will be happening.

# LFM Holiday Season Project: The Nest

We are once again collecting items needed by The Nest as our annual Holiday
Season Project.  The Nest provides a crisis childcare program, domestic
violence counseling and an advocacy program, a parent education and support
program, and a crisis care program.  It is located near the Meetinghouse at
Limestone and Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd.  For more information about the
Nest, see http://thenestlexington.org/.

The first stage of this project begins immediately and continues until 12/15.
During this period, we collect gifts for young children as part of the
Nest's Reindeer Express project.  Place your gifts in the large magenta tab
that is located at the end of the hall as you enter the Social Hall.

After December 15 we will collect items that the Nest needs year round.  

**ITEMS FOR REINDEER EXPRESS (by Dec 15)** (do not wrap your contributions):

* new toys
* wrapping paper, gift bags, ribbon, and tape
* books for 5 and under
* coats for children ages 5 and under
* hats, mittens, scarves and gloves for 5 and under

**Items needed after Dec 15 include:** diapers, baby wipes, formula, baby toiletries,
general toiletries, new or gently used baby equipment, new or gently used
children's clothing (birth to size 5) new or gently used children's toys,
nonperishable food items, and cleaning supplies.

# Adult Religious Education (First Hour)

We meet in the Library, and start promptly at **9:15am**- even if some of us have

If you have an idea for a topic for First Hour Discussion please send it to
the members of the ARE Committee (**Audrey R**, **Elizabeth L**, **Melva
Sue P**, and **Kitrina K**) at **are@lexingtonfriends.org**.

We usually (but not always) anchor the discussion with a reading.  We encourage
you to lead the discussion of your topic, but we will seek another leader if
you prefer.

We gather at 6:45, begin supper at **7:00pm**, and the program runs from 7:45
until 9:00.

Bring a dish to serve 6. Don't have time to get a dish ready?  Join us anyway.
There's always enough.
