# Upcoming Events

There are some upcoming events which may require advance registration & planning.

July 27-31 are the dates for the **OVYM annual sessions**, held at Earlham
College in Richmond, IN.

April 7-9 is when our annual Pine Mountain Retreat will be happening.

# Adult Religious Education (First Hour)

This month's topics include: 

* **July 10** *Reflections on Time* - **Audrey R**
* **June 24** *Poet William Stafford: Pacifism & the Good War*

We meet in the Library, and start promptly at **9:15am**- even if some of us have
not yet arrived.  We end at 10:15am to join the hymn singing.

If you have an idea for a topic for First Hour Discussion please send it to
the members of the ARE Committee (**Audrey R**, **Elizabeth L**, **Melva
Sue P**, and **Kitrina K**) at **are@lexingtonfriends.org**.

We usually (but not always) anchor the discussion with a reading.  We encourage
you to lead the discussion of your topic, but we will seek another leader if
you prefer.

# Potlucks

Our normal, Friday evening potlucks are on hold for July.  However, there will
be a **potluck bruch** on **Saturday. July 23**.  We'll gather at **9:15am** and
the topic will be *What does it mean to co-sponsor a refugee family?*.
