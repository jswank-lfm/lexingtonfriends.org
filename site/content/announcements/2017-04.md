you to lead the discussion of your topic, but we will seek another leader if
you prefer.

## First Hour, April 2

Each year, Lexington Meeting pays an annual "fair share" assessment to our
Yearly Meeting.  A starting amount is calculated on the basis of the number of
members we report.  We will meet to discuss whether or not this amount should
be adjusted higher or lower than that amount according to our ability to pay.
Peter Hardy will lead this discussion.
