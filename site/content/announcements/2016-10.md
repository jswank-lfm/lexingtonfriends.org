# Save the Date

**November 6** We will be hosting the *All Kentucky Friends Gathering* at the Meetinghouse.  Breakfast will be served by us, and there will be a potluck lunch.  In the afternoon, children go to the indoor pool in Georgetown.  Runs from 8:30am to 4pm.

**April 7-9, 2017** is when our annual Pine Mountain Retreat will be happening.


# Vocal Ministry Workshop

A *Vocal Ministry workshop*, led by **Ben Lloyd**, will be held on the 
Fri. Oct. 7  potluck followed by a *Introduction to Vocal Ministry workshop*
on Saturday from 10:00am-2:00pm with a pizza lunch.

The workshop is sponsored by our Ministry & Worship Committee. This workshop
will help us understand more clearly when what we have in our hearts is coming
from the Spirit.  It is something you won't want to miss. 

Benjamin Lloyd of Abington Monthly Meeting, Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, offers
a gentle and interactive workshop on vocal ministry. Using his research on how
Quakers have historically described rising and speaking in meeting for worship,
their descriptions of the conditions necessary for powerful ministry, and his
own years of experience as a Friend and a teacher of acting, Ben weaves
together a workshop which avoids teaching "what" Friends should share, but
rather supports what Friends feel when sharing. Drawing a distinction between
"thinking" and "feeling" during worship, Ben provides readings to consider and
exercises to enjoy, meant to stimulate one's own unique felt experience before,
during, and after speaking.

If you have an idea for a topic for First Hour Discussion please send it to
the members of the ARE Committee (**Audrey R**, **Elizabeth L**, **Melva
Sue P**, and **Kitrina K**) at **are@lexingtonfriends.org**.

We usually (but not always) anchor the discussion with a reading.  We encourage
you to lead the discussion of your topic, but we will seek another leader if
you prefer.

## First Hour, October 2
We will continue our discussion on Quaker poet William Stafford.   Stafford was
a pacifist and a conscientious objector (CO) during the "good war"
(World War II) when that war was widely supported and being an conscientious
objector was seen by some as equivalent to treason. 

We meet in the Library from 9:15 to 10:15 a.m.  Melva Sue Priddy will lead us.

Click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8QtC5CDCC_abWY5WldaZmZJWkk/view?usp=sharing) for a printable (PDF format) copy of some of Stafford's poems.

Please join us.  There's no need to have participated in our earlier
discussions on this topic to understand and participate in this week's
discussion.
