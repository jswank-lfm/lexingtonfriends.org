# Save the Date

**April 7-9, 2017** is when our annual Pine Mountain Retreat will be happening.

# Adult Religious Education (First Hour)

* **January 8** *Introduction to Personal Ecology* - **Pat G.**
* **January 15** *TBA* - **TBA**
* **January 22** *TBA* - **TBA**
* **January 29** *TBA* - **TBA**

We meet in the Library, and start promptly at **9:15am**- even if some of us have
not yet arrived.  We end at 10:15am to join the hymn singing.

If you have an idea for a topic for First Hour Discussion please send it to
the members of the ARE Committee (**Audrey R**, **Elizabeth L**, **Melva
Sue P**, and **Kitrina K**) at **are@lexingtonfriends.org**.

We usually (but not always) anchor the discussion with a reading.  We encourage
you to lead the discussion of your topic, but we will seek another leader if
you prefer.

## First Hour, January 8

*Introduction to Personal Ecology* 

Pat is a member of Berea Friends Meeting.  She writes:

> I will do a 15-20 minute user-friendly presentation on the science of what
> sustains life from the perspectives of deep ecology, occupational science
> (occupation being broadly defined as what we do with ourselves), and
> spiritual traditions.  We are all aware that many decisions we face are
> difficult and complex.  The personal ecology model offers insights into how
> those decisions might be made so that health, well-being, and community can
> be strengthened.  
>
> Queries participants might ponder in preparation for this
> topic are: 
>
> 1. In what situations do I feel really alive?  
> 2. In what situations do I feel less alive?  
>
> I am looking forward to sharing and  learning with you all, and to deepening
> my acquaintance with Lexington  Friends.
