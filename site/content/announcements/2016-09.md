## First Hour, September 4

The poet William Stafford was a pacifist and a conscientious objector during
the "good war" when it was very unpopular. In light of LFM Friends
considering CO status for younger Friends recently, we thought to look at what
those years were like for William Stafford and see how his thoughts still apply
today. Please join us.

## First Hour, September 18

*Names in the Bible* led by **Stan B.**. We will discuss personal names in the
Jewish ("Old" Testament) and Christian ("New" Testament) scriptures and what
they mean.

Here is a simple quiz: 

1. How any names are in the OT and NT? 
2. How many more men than women? 
3. What percent are women and men? 
4. What are the most frequent names? 
5. What do these names tell us about the writers and those who compiled the books?

Come for some good learning, deep discussion and some fun.

## First Hour, September 25

Katie Breslin who runs young adult programs at FCNL, will be with us this
coming Sunday.   She will meet with us during First Hour to tell us about
FCNL's Advocacy Corps.  She will also be with us after meeting for worship
at Sandwich Sunday

The Advocacy Corps is a 9 month-long program where young adults between the
ages of 19-30 get paid to organize their local community around federal
legislation. Advocacy Corps organizers connect local activists and leaders with
their local member of Congress to affect big, long-term change. During the
course of this program, Advocacy Corps organizers learn critical organizing
skills and put them into practice with hands-on leadership experience.

Advocacy Corps organizers:

* Recruit local volunteers
* Meet with members of Congress
* Organize others to meet with members of Congress and their staff
* Write letters to the editor and op-eds
* Mobilize people to come to Washington

Please join us.  There's no need to have participated in our earlier
discussions on this topic to understand and participate in this week's
discussion.
